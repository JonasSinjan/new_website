abstract = {The design and later use of modern spectropolarimeters and magnetographs require a number of tolerance specifications that allow the developers to build the instrument and then the scientists to interpret the data accuracy. Such specifications depend both on device-specific features and on the physical assumptions underlying the particular measurement technique. Here we discuss general properties of every magnetograph, such as the detectability thresholds for the vector magnetic field and the line-of-sight velocity, as well as specific properties of a given type of instrument, namely, that based on a pair of nematic liquid crystal variable retarders and a Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot etalon (or several) for carrying out the light polarization modulation and spectral analysis, respectively. We derive formulae that give the detection thresholds in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio of the observations and the polarimetric efficiencies of the instrument. Relationships are also established between inaccuracies in the solar physical quantities and instabilities in the instrument parameters. Such relationships allow, for example, one to translate scientific requirements for the velocity or the magnetic field into requirements for temperature or voltage stability. We also demonstrate that this type of magnetograph can theoretically reach the optimum polarimetric efficiencies of an ideal polarimeter, regardless of the optics in between the modulator and the analyzer. Such optics induce changes in the instrument parameters that are calculated. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Context. The Solar Orbiter spacecraft will be equipped with a wide range of remote-sensing (RS) and in situ (IS) instruments to record novel and unprecedented measurements of the solar atmosphere and the inner heliosphere. To take full advantage of these new datasets, tools and techniques must be developed to ease multi-instrument and multi-spacecraft studies. In particular the currently inaccessible low solar corona below two solar radii can only be observed remotely. Furthermore techniques must be used to retrieve coronal plasma properties in time and in three dimensional (3D) space. Solar Orbiter will run complex observation campaigns that provide interesting opportunities to maximise the likelihood of linking IS data to their source region near the Sun. Several RS instruments can be directed to specific targets situated on the solar disk just days before data acquisition. To compare IS and RS, data we must improve our understanding of how heliospheric probes magnetically connect to the solar disk. Aims. The aim of the present paper is to briefly review how the current modelling of the Sun and its atmosphere can support Solar Orbiter science. We describe the results of a community-led effort by European Space Agency's Modelling and Data Analysis Working Group (MADAWG) to develop different models, tools, and techniques deemed necessary to test different theories for the physical processes that may occur in the solar plasma. The focus here is on the large scales and little is described with regards to kinetic processes. To exploit future IS and RS data fully, many techniques have been adapted to model the evolving 3D solar magneto-plasma from the solar interior to the solar wind. A particular focus in the paper is placed on techniques that can estimate how Solar Orbiter will connect magnetically through the complex coronal magnetic fields to various photospheric and coronal features in support of spacecraft operations and future scientific studies. Methods. Recent missions such as STEREO, provided great opportunities for RS, IS, and multi-spacecraft studies. We summarise the achievements and highlight the challenges faced during these investigations, many of which motivated the Solar Orbiter mission. We present the new tools and techniques developed by the MADAWG to support the science operations and the analysis of the data from the many instruments on Solar Orbiter. Results. This article reviews current modelling and tool developments that ease the comparison of model results with RS and IS data made available by current and upcoming missions. It also describes the modelling strategy to support the science operations and subsequent exploitation of Solar Orbiter data in order to maximise the scientific output of the mission. Conclusions. The on-going community effort presented in this paper has provided new models and tools necessary to support mission operations as well as the science exploitation of the Solar Orbiter data. The tools and techniques will no doubt evolve significantly as we refine our procedure and methodology during the first year of operations of this highly promising mission.},

abstract = {We describe a procedure intended to produce accurate daily estimates of the magnetic flux distribution on the entire solar surface. Models of differential rotation, meridional flow, super-granulation, and the random emergence of background flux elements are used to regularly update unobserved or poorly observed portions of an initial traditional magnetic synoptic map that acts as a seed. Fresh observations replace model estimates when available. Application of these surface magnetic transport models gives us new insight into the distribution and evolution of magnetic flux on the Sun, especially at the poles where canopy effects, limited spatial resolution, and foreshortening result in poor measurements. We find that meridional circulation has a considerable effect on the distribution of polar magnetic fields. We present a modeled polar field distribution as well as time series of the difference between the northern and southern polar magnetic flux; this flux imbalance is related to the heliospheric current sheet tilt. We also estimate that the amount of new background magnetic flux needed to sustain the 'quiet-Sun' magnetic field is about 1.1 × 1023 Mx d-1 (equivalent to several large active regions) at the spatial resolution and epoch of our maps. We comment on the diffusive properties of supergranules, ephemeral regions, and intranetwork flux. The maps are available on the NSO World Wide Web page.},

abstract = {Over the solar-activity cycle, there are extended periods where significant discrepancies occur between the spacecraft-observed total (unsigned) open magnetic flux and that determined from coronal models. In this article, the total open heliospheric magnetic flux is computed using two different methods and then compared with results obtained from in-situ interplanetary magnetic-field observations. The first method uses two different types of photospheric magnetic-field maps as input to the Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) model: i) traditional Carrington or diachronic maps, and ii) Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport model synchronic maps. The second method uses observationally derived helium and extreme-ultraviolet coronal-hole maps overlaid on the same magnetic-field maps in order to compute total open magnetic flux. The diachronic and synchronic maps are both constructed using magnetograms from the same source, namely the National Solar Observatory Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope and Vector Spectromagnetograph. The results of this work show that the total open flux obtained from observationally derived coronal holes agrees remarkably well with that derived from WSA, especially near solar minimum. This suggests that, on average, coronal models capture well the observed large-scale coronal-hole structure over most of the solar cycle. Both methods show considerable deviations from total open flux deduced from spacecraft data, especially near solar maximum, pointing to something other than poorly determined coronal-hole area specification as the source of these discrepancies.},

We introduce analytical response functions and their main properties as an important diagnostic tool that help understand Stokes profile formation physics and the meaning of well-known behaviors of standard inversion codes of the radiative transfer equation often used to measure solar magnetic fields. Methods. A Milne-Eddington model atmosphere is used as an example where response functions are analytical. A sample spectral line has been chosen to show the main qualitative properties. Results. We show that analytic response functions readily provide explanations for various well-known behaviors of spectral lines, such as the sensitivity of visible lines to weak magnetic fields or the trade-offs often detected in inversion codes between the Milne-Eddington thermodynamic parameters. We also show that response functions are helpful in selecting sample wavelengths optimized for specific parameter diagnostics. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

abstract = {The problem of multidimensional LTE line formation in a magnetic field is solved in a model of an unresolved magnetic element imbedded in the solar photosphere. Horizontal and vertical variations of the physical parameters are included. Calculations show that, in circular polarization analysis, the centre of gravity displacement of the line profile gives a very good measurement of the longitudinal field averaged over the area observed. For small line weakenings the accuracy is probably better than 10{\%}. Also the method is not affected by Zeeman saturation. A method based on centre of gravity measurements is proposed for inferring a 'model-independent' value of the average longitudinal field inside an unresolved magnetic element.},

abstract = {The spectropolarimetric signature of models of small-scale magnetic features is well understood at the centre of the solar disc, but has been little studied near the solar limb, mainly because the detailed geometry of the flux tubes must then be taken into account in a realistic analysis. We present multi-ray calculations of Stokes profiles through arrays of 2-D magnetohydrostatic models of small flux tubes. We compare the Stokes profile shapes and Stokes based diagnostics (Q to V ratio, V amplitude, magnetic line ratio, centre of gravity wavelengths, etc.) resulting from plane-parallel and 2-D flux-tube models at different limb distances for two lines in the visible and an infrared H-band line. For the visible lines around 5250 {\AA} all the diagnostics we have studied, with the exception of the Q and U to V ratio, are significantly affected by the finite size of the flux tubes and the passage of the rays through non-magnetic material near the limb. We show that magnetic filling factors and the global magnetic flux may be underestimated using the usual calibration techniques. In addition, near the solar limb the magnetic line ratio can move into a regime that is forbidden according to simpler models. The spatially averaged longitudinal field derived from the centre-of-gravity method also becomes strongly model dependent. The thermal structure of the nonmagnetic atmosphere appears to play a particularly important role in determining the values of these diagnostic parameters. The infrared line at 1.5648 $\mu$m, on the one hand, reacts little to the external atmosphere and provides superior diagnostics of both the magnetic field strength and filling factor. On the other hand, for a flux tube with a sharp boundary this line shows little dependence on the flux-tube diameter, in contrast to the earlier findings of Zayer et al. (1989).},

abstract = {The subarcsecond bright points (BPs) associated with the small-scale magnetic fields in the lower solar atmosphere are advected by the evolution of the photospheric granules. We measure various quantities related to the horizontal motions of the BPs observed in two wavelengths, including the velocity autocorrelation function. A 1hr time sequence of wideband H$\alpha$ observations conducted at the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope (SST) and a 4hr Hinode G-band time sequence observed with the Solar Optical Telescope are used in this work. We follow 97 SST and 212 Hinode BPs with 3800 and 1950 individual velocity measurements, respectively. For its high cadence of 5s as compared to 30s for Hinode data, we emphasize more the results from SST data. The BP positional uncertainty achieved by SST is as low as 3km. The position errors contribute 0.75km2s-2 to the variance of the observed velocities. The raw and corrected velocity measurements in both directions, i.e., (vx , vy ), have Gaussian distributions with standard deviations of (1.32, 1.22) and (1.00, 0.86)kms-1, respectively. The BP motions have correlation times of about 22-30 s. We construct the power spectrum of the horizontal motions as a function of frequency, a quantity that is useful and relevant to the studies of generation of Alfv{\'{e}}n waves. Photospheric turbulent diffusion at timescales less than 200 s is found to satisfy a power law with an index of 1.59. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

abstract = {We present a new method of Stokes inversion of spectropolarimetric data and evaluate it by taking the example of a SUNRISE/IMaX observation. An archive of synthetic Stokes profiles is obtained by the spectral synthesis of state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations and a realistic degradation to the level of the observed data. The definition of a merit function allows the archive to be searched for the synthetic Stokes profiles that match the observed profiles best. In contrast to traditional Stokes inversion codes, which solve the Unno-Rachkovsky equations for the polarized radiative transfer numerically and fit the Stokes profiles iteratively, the new technique provides the full set of atmospheric parameters. This gives us the ability to start an MHD simulation that takes the inversion result as initial condition. After a relaxation process of half an hour solar time we obtain physically consistent MHD data sets with a target similar to the observation. The new MHD simulation is used to repeat the method in a second iteration, which further improves the match between observation and simulation, resulting in a factor of 2.2 lower mean {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} value. One advantage of the new technique is that it provides the physical parameters on a geometrical height scale. It constitutes a first step towards inversions giving results consistent with the MHD equations.},

abstract = {A polarization modulator based on Liquid Crystal Variable Retarders (LCVRs) will be used in the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) for the Solar Orbiter mission to measure the complete Stokes vector of the incoming light. PHI is one of the six remote sensing instruments onboard of this space mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA) with strong NASA participation. It is an imaging spectro-polarimeter that will acquire high resolution solar magnetograms. Also the LCVRs will be used in the polarization modulator of the METIS instrument (Multi Element Telescope for Imaging and Spectroscopy). METIS is a solar coronagraph that will analyze the linear polarization for observations of the visible-light K-corona. The polarization modulators are described in this work including the optical, mechanical, thermal and electrical aspects. Both modulators will consist of two identical LCVRs with a relative azimuth orientation of 45{\textordmasculine} for PHI and parallel for the METIS modulator. In the first case, the configuration allows the analysis of the full Stokes vector with maximum polarimetric efficiencies. In the second setup, wide acceptance angles (≤ ±7°) are obtained. This works presents the preliminary results obtained for the full representative prototypes from the verification and environmental test campaign in progress currently. The main performances were measured and analyzed including polarimetric efficiencies, wavefront error transmission, beam deviation and transmittance. This valuable information will allow to consolidate the detailed design of these devices increasing its TRL to 6 and to proceed to the manufacturing of the Qualification Model (QM) and Flight Models (FM).},

Virtually no p-mode leakage is seen in the HMI magnetograms, but it is significant in the MDI magnetograms. 12-hour and 24-hour periodicities are detected in strong fields in the HMI magnetograms. The newly calibrated MDI full-disk magnetograms have been corrected for the zero-point offset and underestimation of the flux density. The noise is 26. 4 Mx cm -2 for the MDI one-minute full-disk magnetograms and 16. 2 Mx cm -2 for the five-minute full-disk magnetograms observed with four-arcsecond resolution. The variation of the noise over the Sun's disk found in MDI magnetograms is likely due to the different optical distortions in the left- and right-circular analyzers, which allows the granulation and p-mode to leak in as noise. Saturation sometimes seen in sunspot umbrae in MDI magnetograms is caused by the low intensity and the limitation of the onboard computation. The noise in the HMI and MDI line-of-sight magnetic-field synoptic charts appears to be fairly uniform over the entire map. The noise is 2. 3 Mx cm -2 for HMI charts and 5. 0 Mx cm -2 for MDI charts. No evident periodicity is found in the HMI synoptic charts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

We focus on the intensity to linear and circular polarization crosstalk that affect polarimetric accuracy of full-disk vector magnetic-field measurements. An attempt is made to correct such crosstalk and to reconstruct full-disk vector magnetic fields from polarization data. By analyzing the data taken at 31 filter positions from −0.3 {\AA} to 0.3 {\AA} off the spectral line Fe i$\lambda$5324.19 {\AA} spaced by 0.02 {\AA}, we estimate that the intensity to linear and circular polarization crosstalks are less than 0.1{\%} (≈ 10 G) of the quiet-Sun intensity. The method, which uses background maps obtained by averaging over many Stokes -Q, -U, and -V images to correct the crosstalks of I-to-Q, -U, and -V, is proved to be effective.},

The required transformations of the magnetic field vector and the geometric mapping of the observed field in the image plane into the heliographic plane have been described. Here we discuss the total transformation of specific vector magnetograms to detail the problems and procedures that one should be aware of in analyzing observational magnetograms. The effect of the 180-deg ambiguity of the observed transverse field is considered as well as the effect of curvature of the photosphere. Specific results for active regions AR 2684 (23 September, 1980) and AR 4474 (26 April, 1984) from the Marshall Space Flight Center Vector Magnetograph are described which point to the need for the heliographic projection in determining the field structure of an active region.},

abstract = {Context. The design of modern instruments does not only imply thorough studies of instrumental effects but also a good understanding of the scientific analysis planned for the data. Aims. We investigate the reliability of Milne-Eddington (ME) inversions of high-resolution magnetograph measurements such as those to be obtained with the Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment (IMaX) aboard the Sunrise balloon. We also provide arguments to choose either Fe i 525.02 or 525.06 nm as the most suitable line for IMaX. Methods. We reproduce an IMaX observation using magnetoconvection simulations of the quiet Sun and synthesizing the four Stokes profiles emerging from them. The profiles are degraded by spatial and spectral resolution, noise, and limited wavelength sampling, just as real IMaX measurements. We invert these data and estimate the uncertainties in the retrieved physical parameters caused by the ME approximation and the spectral sampling. Results. It is possible to infer the magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth, and line-of-sight velocity from standard IMaX measurements (4 Stokes parameters, 5 wavelength points, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 1000) applying ME inversions to any of the Fe i lines at 525 nm. We also find that telescope diffraction has important effects on the spectra coming from very high resolution observations of inhomogeneous atmospheres. Diffration reduces the amplitude of the polarization signals and changes the asymmetry of the Stokes profiles. Conclusions. The two Fe i lines at 525 nm meet the scientific requirements of IMaX, but Fe i 525.02 nm is to be preferred because it leads to smaller uncertainties in the retrieved parameters and offers a better detectability of the weakest (linear) polarization signals prevailing in the quiet Sun.},

abstract = {In the quiet solar photosphere, the mixed polarity fields form a magnetic carpet that continuously evolves due to dynamical interaction between the convective motions and magnetic field. This interplay is a viable source to heat the solar atmosphere. In this work, we used the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and the Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment instrument on the Sunrise balloon-borne observatory, as time-dependent lower boundary conditions, to study the evolution of the coronal magnetic field. We use a magneto-frictional relaxation method, including hyperdiffusion, to produce a time series of three-dimensional nonlinear force-free fields from a sequence of photospheric LOS magnetograms. Vertical flows are added up to a height of 0.7 Mm in the modeling to simulate the non-force-freeness at the photosphere-chromosphere layers. Among the derived quantities, we study the spatial and temporal variations of the energy dissipation rate and energy flux. Our results show that the energy deposited in the solar atmosphere is concentrated within 2 Mm of the photosphere and there is not sufficient energy flux at the base of the corona to cover radiative and conductive losses. Possible reasons and implications are discussed. Better observational constraints of the magnetic field in the chromosphere are crucial to understand the role of the magnetic carpet in coronal heating.},

The HMI instrument is part of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) that was launched on 11 February 2010. The instrument is designed to measure the Doppler shift, intensity, and vector magnetic field at the solar photosphere using the 6173 {\AA} Fe i absorption line. The instrument consists of a front-window filter, a telescope, a set of waveplates for polarimetry, an image-stabilization system, a blocking filter, a five-stage Lyot filter with one tunable element, two wide-field tunable Michelson interferometers, a pair of 4096 2 pixel cameras with independent shutters, and associated electronics. Each camera takes a full-disk image roughly every 3. 75 seconds giving an overall cadence of 45 seconds for the Doppler, intensity, and line-of-sight magnetic-field measurements and a slower cadence for the full vector magnetic field. This article describes the design of the HMI instrument and provides an overview of the pre-launch calibration efforts.

The atlas covers the wavelength range 405-2300 nm and was observed at the Institut f{\"{u}}r Astrophysik, G{\"{o}}ttingen (IAG), with a Fourier transform spectrograph (FTS). In contrast to other FTS atlases, the entire visible wavelength range was observed simultaneously using only one spectrograph setting. We compare the wavelength solution of the new atlas to the Kitt Peak solar flux atlases and to the HARPS frequency-comb calibrated solar atlas. Comparison reveals systematics in the two Kitt Peak FTS atlases resulting from their wavelength scale construction, and shows consistency between the IAG and the HARPS atlas. We conclude that the IAG atlas is precise and accurate on the order of ± 10 m s-1 in the wavelength range 405-1065 nm, while the Kitt Peak atlases show deviations as large as several ten to 100 m s-1. We determine absolute convective blueshift across the spectrum from the IAG atlas and report slight differences relative to results from the Kitt Peak atlas that we attribute to the differences between wavelength scales. We conclude that benchmark solar data with accurate wavelength solution are crucial to better understand the effect of convection on stellar radial velocity measurements, which is one of the main limitations of Doppler spectroscopy at m s-1 precision.},

abstract = {The Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment (IMaX) is a spectropolarimeter built by four institutions in Spain that flew on board the Sunrise balloon-borne solar observatory in June 2009 for almost six days over the Arctic Circle. As a polarimeter, IMaX uses fast polarization modulation (based on the use of two liquid crystal retarders), real-time image accumulation, and dual-beam polarimetry to reach polarization sensitivities of 0.1{\%}. As a spectrograph, the instrument uses a LiNbO3 etalon in double pass and a narrow band pre-filter to achieve a spectral resolution of 85 m{\AA}. IMaX uses the high-Zeeman-sensitive line of Fe i at 5250.2 {\AA} and observes all four Stokes parameters at various points inside the spectral line. This allows vector magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and intensity frames to be produced that, after reconstruction, reach spatial resolutions in the 0. 15 - 0. 18 arcsec range over a 50×50 arcsec field of view. Time cadences vary between 10 and 33 s, although the shortest one only includes longitudinal polarimetry. The spectral line is sampled in various ways depending on the applied observing mode, from just two points inside the line to 11 of them. All observing modes include one extra wavelength point in the nearby continuum. Gauss equivalent sensitivities are 4 G for longitudinal fields and 80 G for transverse fields per wavelength sample. The line-of-sight velocities are estimated with statistical errors of the order of 5 - 40 m s-1. The design, calibration, and integration phases of the instrument, together with the implemented data reduction scheme, are described in some detail. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

@article{jafarzadeh_inclinations_2014,
abstract = {Context. High levels of horizontal magnetic flux have been reported in the quiet-Sun internetwork, often based on Stokes profile inversions. Aims. Here we introduce a new method for deducing the inclination of magnetic elements and use it to test magnetic field inclinations from inversions. Methods. We determine accurate positions of a set of small, bright magnetic elements in high spatial resolution images sampling different photospheric heights obtained by the Sunrise balloon-borne solar observatory. Together with estimates of the formation heights of the employed spectral bands, these provide us with the inclinations of the magnetic features. We also compute the magnetic inclination angle of the same magnetic features from the inversion of simultaneously recorded Stokes parameters. Results. Our new, geometric method returns nearly vertical fields (average inclination of around 14° with a relatively narrow distribution having a standard deviation of 6°). In strong contrast to this, the traditionally used inversions give almost horizontal fields (average inclination of 75 ± 8°) for the same small magnetic features, whose linearly polarised Stokes profiles are adversely affected by noise. We show that for such magnetic features inversions overestimate the flux in horizontal magnetic fields by an order of magnitude. Conclusions. The almost vertical field of bright magnetic features from our geometric method is clearly incompatible with the nearly horizontal magnetic fields obtained from the inversions. This indicates that the amount of magnetic flux in horizontal fields deduced from inversions is overestimated in the presence of weak Stokes signals, in particular if Stokes Q and U are close to or under the noise level. Inversions should be used with great caution when applied to data with no clear Stokes Q and no U signal. By combining the proposed method with inversions we are not just improving the inclination, but also the field strength. This technique allows us to analyse features that are not reliably treated by inversions, thus greatly extending our capability to study the complete magnetic field of the quiet Sun.},

abstract = {Solar Orbiter is the first space mission observing the solar plasma both in situ and remotely, from a close distance, in and out of the ecliptic. The ultimate goal is to understand how the Sun produces and controls the heliosphere, filling the Solar System and driving the planetary environments. With six remote-sensing and four in-situ instrument suites, the coordination and planning of the operations are essential to address the following four top-level science questions: (1) What drives the solar wind and where does the coronal magnetic field originate?; (2) How do solar transients drive heliospheric variability?; (3) How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle radiation that fills the heliosphere?; (4) How does the solar dynamo work and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere? Maximising the mission's science return requires considering the characteristics of each orbit, including the relative position of the spacecraft to Earth (affecting downlink rates), trajectory events (such as gravitational assist manoeuvres), and the phase of the solar activity cycle. Furthermore, since each orbit's science telemetry will be downloaded over the course of the following orbit, science operations must be planned at mission level, rather than at the level of individual orbits. It is important to explore the way in which those science questions are translated into an actual plan of observations that fits into the mission, thus ensuring that no opportunities are missed. First, the overarching goals are broken down into specific, answerable questions along with the required observations and the so-called Science Activity Plan (SAP) is developed to achieve this. The SAP groups objectives that require similar observations into Solar Orbiter Observing Plans, resulting in a strategic, top-level view of the optimal opportunities for science observations during the mission lifetime. This allows for all four mission goals to be addressed. In this paper, we introduce Solar Orbiter's SAP through a series of examples and the strategy being followed.},

abstract = {The production of science-ready data from major solar telescopes requires expertise beyond that of the typical observer. This is a consequence of the increasing complexity of instruments and observing sequences, which require calibrations and corrections for instrumental and seeing effects that are not only difficult to measure, but are also coupled in ways that require careful analysis in the design of the correction procedures. Modern space-based telescopes have data-processing pipelines capable of routinely producing well-characterized data products. High resolution imaging spectropolarimeters at ground-based telescopes need similar data pipelines. We present new methods for flat-fielding spectropolarimetric data acquired with telecentric Fabry-Perot instruments and a new approach for accurate camera co-alignment for image restoration.We document a procedure that forms the basis of current state-of- the-art processing of data from the CRISP imaging spectropolarimeter at the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope (SST). By collecting, implementing, and testing a suite of computer programs, we have defined a data reduction pipeline for this instrument. This pipeline, CRISPRED, streamlines the process of making science-ready data. It is implemented and operated in IDL, with time-consuming steps delegated to C. CRISPRED will also be the basis for the data pipeline of the forthcoming CHROMIS instrument.},

abstract = {Context. Inversion codes for the polarized radiative transfer equation, when applied to spectropolarimetric observations (i.e., Stokes vector) in spectral lines, can be used to infer the temperature T, line-of-sight velocity vlos, and magnetic field B as a function of the continuum optical-depth $\tau$c. However, they do not directly provide the gas pressure Pg or density $\rho$. In order to obtain these latter parameters, inversion codes rely instead on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) in addition to the equation of state (EOS). Unfortunately, the assumption of HE is rather unrealistic across magnetic field lines, causing estimations of Pg and $\rho$ to be unreliable. This is because the role of the Lorentz force, among other factors, is neglected. Unreliable gas pressure and density also translate into an inaccurate conversion from optical depth $\tau$c to geometrical height z. Aims. We aim at improving the determination of the gas pressure and density via the application of magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equilibrium instead of HE. Methods. We develop a method to solve the momentum equation under MHS equilibrium (i.e., taking the Lorentz force into account) in three dimensions. The method is based on the iterative solution of a Poisson-like equation. Considering the gas pressure Pg and density $\rho$ from three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of sunspots as a benchmark, we compare the results from the application of HE and MHS equilibrium using boundary conditions with different degrees of realism. Employing boundary conditions that can be applied to actual observations, we find that HE retrieves the gas pressure and density with an error smaller than one order of magnitude (compared to the MHD values) in only about 47{\%} of the grid points in the three-dimensional domain. Moreover, the inferred values are within a factor of two of the MHD values in only about 23{\%} of the domain. This translates into an error of about 160 - 200 km in the determination of the z - $\tau$c conversion (i.e., Wilson depression). On the other hand, the application of MHS equilibrium with similar boundary conditions allows determination of Pg and $\rho$ with an error smaller than an order of magnitude in 84{\%} of the domain. The inferred values are within a factor of two in more than 55{\%} of the domain. In this latter case, the z - $\tau$c conversion is obtained with an accuracy of 30 - 70 km. Inaccuracies are due in equal part to deviations from MHS equilibrium and to inaccuracies in the boundary conditions. Results. Compared to HE, our new method, based on MHS equilibrium, significantly improves the reliability in the determination of the density, gas pressure, and conversion between geometrical height z and continuum optical depth $\tau$c. This method could be used in conjunction with the inversion of the radiative transfer equation for polarized light in order to determine the thermodynamic, kinematic, and magnetic parameters of the solar atmosphere.},

We present a software simulator for the modeling of astronomical instrumentation, which includes platform effects and software processing. It is an end-to-end simulator, from the entrance of the telescope to the data acquisition at the detector, along with software blocks dealing, e.g., with demodulation, inversion, and compression. Developed following the Solar Orbiter/Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) instrument, it comprises elements such as a filtergraph, polarimetric modulator, detector, vibrations, and accumulations. Through these, the simulator performs most of the analyses that can be done with light in astronomy, such as differential photometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry. The simulator is coded with high flexibility and ease of implementation of new effects and subsystems. Thus, it allows for the user to adapt it to a wide variety of instruments, even not exclusively solar ones, as illustrated with an example of application to a night-time observation. The simulator can provide support in the phase of instrument design and help assess tolerances and test solutions to underperformances arising during the instrument operations. All this makes SOPHISM a very valuable tool for all the stages of astronomical instrument definition, design, operation, and lifetime tracking evaluation.},

abstract = {Context. Inversion techniques applied to the radiative transfer equation for polarized light are capable of inferring the physical parameters in the solar atmosphere (temperature T, magnetic field B, and line-of-sight velocity vlos) from observations of the Stokes vector (i.e., spectropolarimetric observations) in spectral lines. Inferences are usually performed in the (x, y, $\tau$c) domain, where $\tau$c refers to the optical-depth scale. Generally, their determination in the (x, y, z) volume is not possible due to the lack of a reliable estimation of the gas pressure, particularly in regions of the solar surface harboring strong magnetic fields. Aims. We aim to develop a new inversion code capable of reliably inferring the physical parameters in the (x, y, z) domain. Methods. We combine, in a self-consistent way, an inverse solver for the radiative transfer equation (Firtez-DZ) with a solver for the magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium, which derives realistic values of the gas pressure by taking the magnetic pressure and tension into account. Results. We test the correct behavior of the newly developed code with spectropolarimetric observations of two sunspots recorded with the spectropolarimeter (SP) instrument on board the Hinode spacecraft, and we show how the physical parameters are inferred in the (x, y, z) domain, with the Wilson depression of the sunspots arising as a natural consequence of the force balance. In particular, our approach significantly improves upon previous determinations that were based on semiempirical models. Conclusions. Our results open the door for the possibility of calculating reliable electric currents in three dimensions, j(x, y, z), in the solar photosphere. Further consistency checks would include a comparison with other methods that have recently been proposed and which achieve similar goals.},

We found this difference in behaviour to likely be due to the different mechanisms of the formation of the two spectral components. From a simple model based on bivariate polynomial fits to the measured contrasts we confirmed spectral line changes to be a significant driver of facular contribution to variation in solar irradiance. The discrepancy between the continuum contrast reported here and in the literature was shown to arise mainly from differences in spatial resolution and treatment of magnetic signals adjacent to sunspots and pores. {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}BR /{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} Conclusions: HMI is a source of accurate contrasts and low-noise magnetograms covering the full solar disc. For irradiance studies it is important to consider not just the contribution from the continuum but also from the spectral lines. In order not to underestimate long-term variations in solar irradiance, irradiance models should take the greater contrast per unit magnetic flux associated with magnetic features with low magnetic flux into account.},

abstract = {The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory produces line-of-sight (LOS) observables (Doppler velocity, magnetic-field strength, Fe i line width, line depth, and continuum intensity) as well as vector magnetic-field maps at the solar surface. The accuracy of LOS observables is dependent on the algorithm used to translate a sequence of HMI filtergrams into the corresponding observables. Using one hour of high-cadence imaging spectropolarimetric observations of a sunspot in the Fe i line at 6173 {\AA} through the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer installed at the Dunn Solar Telescope, and the Milne-Eddington inversion of the corresponding Stokes vectors, we test the accuracy of the observables algorithm currently implemented in the HMI data-analysis pipeline: the MDI-like algorithm. In an attempt to improve the accuracy of HMI observables, we also compare this algorithm to others that may be implemented in the future: a least-squares fit with a Gaussian profile, a least-squares fit with a Voigt profile, and the use of second Fourier coefficients in the MDI-like algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {We present a study of two spectral lines, Fe I 6173 {\AA} and Ni I 6768 {\AA}, that were candidates to be used in the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) for observing Doppler velocity and the vector magnetic field. The line profiles were studied using the Mt. Wilson Observatory, the Advanced Stokes Polarimeter and the Kitt Peak-McMath Pierce telescope and one-meter Fourier transform spectrometer atlas. Both Fe I and Ni I profiles have clean continua and no blends that threaten instrument performance. The Fe I line is 2{\%} deeper, 15{\%} narrower, and has a 6{\%} smaller equivalent width than the Ni I line. The potential of each spectral line to recover pre-assigned solar conditions is tested using a least-squares minimization technique to fit Milne-Eddington models to tens of thousands of line profiles that have been sampled at five spectral positions across the line. Overall, the Fe I line has a better performance than the Ni I line for vector-magnetic-field retrieval. Specifically, the Fe I line is able to determine field strength, longitudinal and transverse flux four times more accurately than the Ni I line in active regions. Inclination and azimuthal angles can be recovered to ≈2 ° above 600 Mx cm-2 for Fe I and above 1000 Mx cm -2 for Ni I. Therefore, the Fe I line better determines the magnetic-field orientation in plage, whereas both lines provide good orientation determination in penumbrae and umbrae. We selected the Fe I spectral line for use in HMI due to its better performance for magnetic diagnostics while not sacrificing velocity information. The one exception to the better performance of the Fe I line arises when high field strengths combine with high velocities to move the spectral line beyond the effective sampling range. The higher g eff of Fe I means that its useful range of velocity values in regions of strong magnetic field is smaller than Ni I. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

abstract = {Until today, the small size of magnetic elements in quiet-Sun areas has required the application of indirect methods, such as the line-ratio technique or multi-component inversions, to infer their physical properties. A consistent match to the observed Stokes profiles could only be obtained by introducing a magnetic filling factor that specifies the fraction of the observed pixel filled with magnetic field. Here, we investigate the properties of a small magnetic patch in the quiet Sun observed with the IMaX magnetograph on board the balloon-borne telescope Sunrise with unprecedented spatial resolution and low instrumental stray light. We apply an inversion technique based on the numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation to retrieve the temperature stratification and the field strength in the magnetic patch. The observations can be well reproduced with a one-component, fully magnetized atmosphere with a field strength exceeding 1 kG and a significantly enhanced temperature in the mid to upper photosphere with respect to its surroundings, consistent with semi-empirical flux tube models for plage regions. We therefore conclude that, within the framework of a simple atmospheric model, the IMaX measurements resolve the observed quiet-Sun flux tube. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Astronomical Society.

@article{upendran_formation_2021,
abstract = {The solar coronal heating in quiet Sun (QS) and coronal holes (CH), including solar wind formation, are intimately tied by magnetic field dynamics. Thus, a detailed comparative study of these regions is needed to understand the underlying physical processes. CHs are known to have subdued intensity and larger blueshifts in the corona. This work investigates the similarities and differences between CHs and QS in the chromosphere using the Mg II h {\&} k, C II lines, and transition region using Si IV line, for regions with identical absolute magnetic flux density (|B|). We find CHs to have subdued intensity in all the ines, with the difference increasing with line formation height and |B|. The chromospheric lines show excess upflows and downflows in CH, while Si IV shows excess upflows (downflows) in CHs (QS), where the flows increase with |B|. We further demonstrate that the upflows (downflows) in Si IV are correlated with both upflows and downflows (only downflows) in the chromospheric lines. CHs (QS) show larger Si IV upflows (downflows) for similar flows in the chromosphere, suggesting a common origin to these flows. These observations may be explained due to impulsive heating via interchange (closed-loop) reconnection in CHs (QS), resulting in bidirectional flows at different heights, due to differences in magnetic field topologies. Finally, the kinked field lines from interchange reconnection may be carried away as magnetic field rotations and observed as switchbacks. Thus, our results suggest a unified picture of solar wind emergence, coronal heating, and near-Sun switchback formation.},

@article{schlichenmaier_spectropolarimetry_2002,
abstract = {Stokes profiles of sunspot penumbrae show distinct asymmetries, which point to gradients in the velocity field and in the magnetic field. We present spectropolarimetric measurements of the Stokes vector in the neutral iron triplet at 1564.8 nm taken with the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter (TIP) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) in Tenerife. We report on the peculiarities of the profiles of circularly and linearly polarized light for spots at different heliocentric angles. We elaborate on the spatial dependence of Stokes asymmetries within the penumbra and find for profiles of circularly polarized light: (1) In the center-side penumbra the amplitude difference of Stokes-V exhibits a sign reversal on a radial cut, i.e., in the inner (outer) penumbra the red (blue) lobe is broader and shows a smaller amplitude than the blue (red) lobe. (2) In the outer limb-side penumbra (beyond the magnetic neutral line) the red lobe is broader and of less amplitude than the blue lobe. (3) Along the magnetic neutral line we find abnormal Stokes-V profiles, which consist of more than 2 lobes. This indicates the presence of two polarities. For small heliocentric angles abnormal profiles are also seen beyond the magnetic neutral line in the outer penumbra. (4) Maps of the net circular polarization have the tendency to be antisymmetric with respect to the axis that connects disk center with spot center. This finding is striking, because corresponding maps for Fe I 630.25 are symmetric. For linearly polarized profiles we extract the following features: (5) On the center-side penumbra at a heliocentric angle of 56° a Doppler-shift as high as 5 km s-1 can be directly measured by the splitting of the $\pi$-component of the linearly polarized component. (6) In limb-side penumbrae, the profiles of the $\pi$-component show the typical asymmetry properties of the Evershed flow as observed in Stokes-I of magnetically insensitive lines. (7) In the outer center-and limb-side penumbrae the center of the $\pi$-component is blue-shifted relative to the zero-crossing of the V-profile. Motivated by the moving tube model of Schlichenmaier et al. (1998b), we construct simple model atmospheres featuring hot upflows and cool outflows and calculate corresponding synthetic V-profiles. These profiles are compared with our measured ones and with observed V-profiles in Fe I 630.25 from other authors. We find that the synthetic V-profiles can reproduce all essential characteristics of observed V-profiles for both lines.},

An automated processing pipeline keeps pace with observations to produce observable quantities, including the photospheric vector magnetic field, from sequences of filtergrams. The basic vector-field frame list cadence is 135 seconds, but to reduce noise the filtergrams are combined to derive data products every 720 seconds. The primary 720 s observables were released in mid-2010, including Stokes polarization parameters measured at six wavelengths, as well as intensity, Doppler velocity, and the line-of-sight magnetic field. More advanced products, including the full vector magnetic field, are now available. Automatically identified HMI Active Region Patches (HARPs) track the location and shape of magnetic regions throughout their lifetime. The vector field is computed using the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector (VFISV) code optimized for the HMI pipeline; the remaining 180 • azimuth ambiguity is resolved with the Minimum Energy (ME0) code. The Milne-Eddington inversion is performed on all full-disk HMI observations. The disambiguation, until recently run only on HARP regions, 3484 J.T. Hoeksema et al. is now implemented for the full disk. Vector and scalar quantities in the patches are used to derive active region indices potentially useful for forecasting; the data maps and indices are collected in the SHARP data series, hmi.sharp{\_}720s. Definitive SHARP processing is completed only after the region rotates off the visible disk; quick-look products are produced in near real time.

abstract = {The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) instrument is part of the remote instruments for the ESA Solar Orbiter (SO), which is scheduled to launch in 2017. PHI captures polarimetric images from the Sun to better understand our nearest star, the Sun. A set of images is acquired with different polarizations, and afterwards is processed to extract the Stokes parameters. As Stokes parameters require the subtraction of the image values, in order to get the desired quality it is necessary to have good contrast in the image and very small displacements between them. As a result an Image Stabilization System (ISS) is required. This paper is focused in the behavior and the main characteristics of this system. This ISS is composed of a camera, a tip-tilt mirror and a control system. The camera is based on a STAR1000 sensor that includes a 10 bits resolution high-speed Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The control system includes a Correla tion Tracking (CT) algorithm that determines the necessary corrections. The tip-tilt mirror is moved based on this corrections to minimize the effects of the spacecraft (S/C) drift and jitter with respect to the Sun. Due to its stringent requirements, a system model has been developed in order to verify that the required parameters can be satisfied. The results show that the ISS is feasible, although the margins are very small. {\textcopyright} 2014 SPIE.},

abstract = {Observations of the sun with high time and spatial resolution in UV and X-rays show that the emission from small isolated magnetic bipoles is intermittent and impulsive, while the steadier emission from larger bipoles appears as the sum of many individual impulses. We refer to the basic unit of impulsive energy release as a nanoflare. The observations suggest, then, that the active X-ray corona of the sun is to be understood as a swarm of nanoflares. This interpretation suggests that the X-ray corona is created by the dissipation at the many tangential discontinuities arising spontaneously in the bipolar fields of the active regions of the sun as a consequence of random continuous motion of the footpoints of the field in the photospheric convection. The quantitative characteristics of the process are inferred from the observed coronal heat input.},

abstract = {Using the IMaX instrument on board the Sunrise stratospheric balloon telescope, we have detected extremely shifted polarization signals around the Fe i 5250.217 {\AA} spectral line within granules in the solar photosphere. We interpret the velocities associated with these events as corresponding to supersonic and magnetic upflows. In addition, they are also related to the appearance of opposite polarities and highly inclined magnetic fields. This suggests that they are produced by the reconnection of emerging magnetic loops through granular upflows. The events occupy an average area of 0.046 arcsec 2 and last for about 80 s, with larger events having longer lifetimes. These supersonic events occur at a rate of 1.3 × 10 -5 occurrences per second per arcsec2. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

This Doppler shift to shorter wavelengths is commonly known as convective blueshift.{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}Aims.{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i/{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} Spectroscopic high-accuracy measurements provide us with a refined determination of the absolute convective blueshift and its atmospheric distribution from disk center to the solar limb.{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}Methods.{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i/{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} We performed systematic observations of the quiet Sun with the Laser Absolute Reference Spectrograph (LARS) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. The solar disk was scanned along the meridian and the equator, from the disk center toward the limb. The solar spectrum around 6173 {\AA} was calibrated with a laser frequency comb on an absolute wavelength scale with an accuracy of a few meters per second. We applied a bisector analysis on the spectral lines to reveal the changes of convective blueshift and line asymmetry at different heliocentric positions.{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}Results.{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i/{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} Being a signature for convective motions, the bisector curve of Fe I 6173.3 {\AA} describes a “C”-shape at disk center. When approaching the solar limb, the bisector transforms into a “{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}”-shape. The analysis of the time- and bisector-averaged line shifts yields three distinct results. Firstly, the center-to-limb variation of Doppler velocities measured with LARS reveals a significant discrepancy (up to 200 m s{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}sup{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}−1{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}sup/{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}) to the full-disk Dopplergrams of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). Secondly, we obtained a significant decrease of convective blueshift toward the solar limb. Thirdly, the line-of-sight effect of solar activity, including {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}p{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i/{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}-mode oscillations and supergranular flows, leads to a scatter of up to ±100 m s{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}sup{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}−1{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}sup/{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} at intermediate heliocentric positions.{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}Conclusions.{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i/{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} The accurate observation of the absolute convective blueshift with LARS allows the identification of systematic discrepancy with Doppler velocities measured by HMI. The center-to-limb variation of HMI suffers from an additional blueshift for {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}$\mu${\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}i/{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.9 that is incompatible with our results. LARS measurements can be taken as a reference for the correction of systematic errors in the synoptic HMI Dopplergrams.},

abstract = {How and where are coronal loops rooted in the solar lower atmosphere? The details of the magnetic environment and its evolution at the footpoints of coronal loops are crucial to understanding the processes of mass and energy supply to the solar corona. To address the above question, we use high-resolution line-of-sight magnetic field data from the Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment instrument on the SUNRISE balloon-borne observatory and coronal observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory of an emerging active region. We find that the coronal loops are often rooted at the locations with minor small-scale but persistent opposite-polarity magnetic elements very close to the larger dominant polarity. These opposite-polarity small-scale elements continually interact with the dominant polarity underlying the coronal loop through flux cancellation. At these locations we detect small inverse Y-shaped jets in chromospheric Ca II H images obtained from the SUNRISE Filter Imager during the flux cancellation. Our results indicate that magnetic flux cancellation and reconnection at the base of coronal loops due to mixed polarity fields might be a crucial feature for the supply of mass and energy into the corona.},

abstract = {We present the first center-to-limb G-band images synthesized from high-resolution simulations of solar magnetoconvection. Toward the limb the simulations show ``hilly'' granulation with dark bands on the far side, bright granulation walls, and striated faculae, similar to observations. At disk center G-band bright points are flanked by dark lanes. The increased brightness in magnetic elements is due to their lower density compared with the surrounding intergranular medium. One thus sees deeper layers where the temperature is higher. At a given geometric height, the magnetic elements are cooler than the surrounding medium. In the G band, the contrast is further increased by the destruction of CH in the low-density magnetic elements. The optical depth unity surface is very corrugated. Bright granules have their continuum optical depth unity 80 km above the mean surface, the magnetic elements 200-300 km below. The horizontal temperature gradient is especially large next to flux concentrations. When viewed at an angle, the deep magnetic elements' optical surface is hidden by the granules and the bright points are no longer visible, except where the ``magnetic valleys'' are aligned with the line of sight. Toward the limb, the low density in the strong magnetic elements causes unit line-of-sight optical depth to occur deeper in the granule walls behind than for rays not going through magnetic elements, and variations in the field strength produce a striated appearance in the bright granule walls.},

abstract = {We compare line-of-sight magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The line-of-sight magnetic signal inferred from the calibrated MDI data is greater than that derived from the HMI data by a factor of 1. 40. This factor varies somewhat with center-to-limb distance. An upper bound to the random noise for the 1″ resolution HMI 720-second magnetograms is 6. 3 Mx cm -2, and 10. 2 Mx cm -2 for the 45-second magnetograms. Virtually no p-mode leakage is seen in the HMI magnetograms, but it is significant in the MDI magnetograms. 12-hour and 24-hour periodicities are detected in strong fields in the HMI magnetograms. The newly calibrated MDI full-disk magnetograms have been corrected for the zero-point offset and underestimation of the flux density. The noise is 26. 4 Mx cm -2 for the MDI one-minute full-disk magnetograms and 16. 2 Mx cm -2 for the five-minute full-disk magnetograms observed with four-arcsecond resolution. The variation of the noise over the Sun's disk found in MDI magnetograms is likely due to the different optical distortions in the left- and right-circular analyzers, which allows the granulation and p-mode to leak in as noise. Saturation sometimes seen in sunspot umbrae in MDI magnetograms is caused by the low intensity and the limitation of the onboard computation. The noise in the HMI and MDI line-of-sight magnetic-field synoptic charts appears to be fairly uniform over the entire map. The noise is 2. 3 Mx cm -2 for HMI charts and 5. 0 Mx cm -2 for MDI charts. No evident periodicity is found in the HMI synoptic charts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The challenges that this presents, however, require a comprehensive software system, which operates on the limited resources a data processing unit in space allows. We implemented such a system for the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) on-board the Solar Orbiter (SO) spacecraft. It ensures autonomous operation to handle long command-response times, easy changing of the processes after new lessons have been learned and meticulous book-keeping of all operations to ensure scientific accuracy. This contribution presents the requirements and main aspects of the software implementation, followed by an example of a task implemented in the software frame, and results from running it on SO/PHI. The presented example shows that the different parts of the software framework work well together, and that the system processes data as we expect. The flexibility of the framework makes it possible to use it as a baseline for future applications with similar needs and limitations as SO/PHI.},

A part of these data consists of scientific observations, being complemented by calibration data to help remove instrumental effects. We present our solution for this discrepancy, implemented for the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on-board the Solar Orbiter mission, the first solar spectropolarimeter in deep space. We implemented an on-board data reduction system that processes calibration data, applies them to the raw science observables, and derives science-ready physical parameters. This process reduces the raw data for a single measurement from 24 images to five, thus reducing the amount of downlinked data, and in addition, renders the transmission of the calibration data unnecessary.

abstract = {We present one Hinode Spectropolarimeter (SP) magnetogram of AR 10930 that produced several major flares. The inversion from Stokes profiles to magnetic field vectors was made using the standard Milne-Eddington code. We successfully applied the Uniform Shear Method for resolving the 180° ambiguity to the magnetogram. The inversion gave very strong magnetic field strengths (near 4500 gauss) for a small portion of area in the umbra. Considering that the observed V-profile of 6301.5 {\AA} was well-fitted as well as a direct estimation of the Zeeman splitting results in 4300-4600 gauss, we think that the field strengths should not be far from the actual value. A cross-comparison of the Hinode SP and SOHO MDI high resolution flux densities shows that the MDI flux density could be significantly underestimated by about a factor of two. In addition, it has a serious negative correlation (the so-called Zeeman saturation effect) with the Hinode SP flux density for umbral regions. Finally, we could successfully obtain a recalibrated MDI magnetogram that has been corrected for the Zeeman saturation effect using not only a pair of MDI intensity and magnetogram data simultaneously observed, but also the relationship from the cross-comparison between the Hinode SP and MDI flux densities. {\textcopyright} 2007.

@article{solanki_polarimetric_2020,
abstract = {Aims. This paper describes the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on the Solar Orbiter mission (SO/PHI), the first magnetograph and helioseismology instrument to observe the Sun from outside the Sun-Earth line. It is the key instrument meant to address the top-level science question: How does the solar dynamo work and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere? SO/PHI will also play an important role in answering the other top-level science questions of Solar Orbiter, while hosting the potential of a rich return in further science. Methods. SO/PHI measures the Zeeman effect and the Doppler shift in the Fe{\^{a}}€» I 617.3 nm spectral line. To this end, the instrument carries out narrow-band imaging spectro-polarimetry using a tunable LiNbO3 Fabry-Perot etalon, while the polarisation modulation is done with liquid crystal variable retarders. The line and the nearby continuum are sampled at six wavelength points and the data are recorded by a 2k × 2k CMOS detector. To save valuable telemetry, the raw data are reduced on board, including being inverted under the assumption of a Milne-Eddington atmosphere, although simpler reduction methods are also available on board. SO/PHI is composed of two telescopes; one, the Full Disc Telescope, covers the full solar disc at all phases of the orbit, while the other, the High Resolution Telescope, can resolve structures as small as 200 km on the Sun at closest perihelion. The high heat load generated through proximity to the Sun is greatly reduced by the multilayer-coated entrance windows to the two telescopes that allow less than 4{\%} of the total sunlight to enter the instrument, most of it in a narrow wavelength band around the chosen spectral line. Results. SO/PHI was designed and built by a consortium having partners in Germany, Spain, and France. The flight model was delivered to Airbus Defence and Space, Stevenage, and successfully integrated into the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. A number of innovations were introduced compared with earlier space-based spectropolarimeters, thus allowing SO/PHI to fit into the tight mass, volume, power and telemetry budgets provided by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft and to meet the (e.g. thermal) challenges posed by the mission's highly elliptical orbit.},

abstract = {Methods. We perform full Stokes ﬁlter polarimetry at diﬀerent solar limb positions with the CN band ﬁlter of the Hinode-SOT Broadband Filter Imager, which represents the ﬁrst scattering polarization observations with suﬃcient spatial resolution to discern the granulation. Hinode-SOT oﬀers unprecedented spatial resolution in combination with high polarimetric sensitivity. The CN band is known to have a signiﬁcant scattering polarization signal, and is sensitive to the Hanle eﬀect. We extend the instrumental polarization calibration routine to the observing wavelength, and correct for various systematic eﬀects.
Results. The scattering polarization for granules (i.e., regions brighter than the median intensity of non-magnetic pixels) is signiﬁcantly larger than for intergranules. We derive that the intergranules (i.e., the remaining non-magnetic pixels) exhibit (9.8 ± 3.0)$\backslash${\%} less scattering polarization for 0.2 {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} µ ≤ 0.3, although systematic eﬀects cannot be completely excluded.
Conclusions. These observations constrain MHD models in combination with (polarized) radiative transfer in terms of CN band line formation, radiation anisotropy, and magnetic ﬁelds.},

But, the EF velocity does show a tendency to be enhanced with sunspot size.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 SPIE. A polarization modulator based on Liquid Crystal Variable Retarders (LCVRs) will be used in the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) for the Solar Orbiter mission to measure the complete Stokes vector of the incoming light. PHI is one of the six remote sensing instruments onboard of this space mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA) with strong NASA participation. It is an imaging spectro-polarimeter that will acquire high resolution solar magnetograms. Also the LCVRs will be used in the polarization modulator of the METIS instrument (Multi Element Telescope for Imaging and Spectroscopy). METIS is a solar coronagraph that will analyze the linear polarization for observations of the visible-light K-corona. The polarization modulators are described in this work including the optical, mechanical, thermal and electrical aspects. Both modulators will consist of two identical LCVRs with a relative azimuth orientation of 45 for PHI and parallel for the METIS modulator. In the first case, the configuration allows the analysis of the full Stokes vector with maximum polarimetric efficiencies. In the second setup, wide acceptance angles (≤ ±7°) are obtained. This works presents the preliminary results obtained for the full representative prototypes from the verification and environmental test campaign in progress currently. The main performances were measured and analyzed including polarimetric efficiencies, wavefront error transmission, beam deviation and transmittance. This valuable information will allow to consolidate the detailed design of these devices increasing its TRL to 6 and to proceed to the manufacturing of the Qualification Model (QM) and Flight Models (FM).},

abstract = {The Sun's spectrum varies with center-to-limb distance, which is usually parameterized by $\mu$ = cos$\theta$, where $\theta$ is the heliocentric angle. This variation is governed by the underlying temperature-density structure of the solar atmosphere. While the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of the continuous spectrum is well known and has been widely used for atmospheric modeling, there has been no systematic exploration of the spectrally resolved CLV. Here we make use of two spectral atlases recorded with the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at the McMath-Pierce facility at Kitt Peak. One spectral atlas obtained 10 arcsec inside the solar limb was recorded in 1978-79 as part of the first survey of the Second Solar Spectrum, while the other atlas is the well used reference NSO/Kitt Peak FTS atlas for the disk center. Both atlases represent fully resolved spectra without any spectral stray light. We then construct an atlas of the limb/disk-center ratio between the two spectra over the wavelength range 4084-9950 {\AA}. This ratio spectrum, which expresses the CLV amplitude relative to the continuum, is as richly structured as the intensity spectrum itself, but the line profiles differ greatly in both shape and amplitude. It is as if we are dealing with a new, unfamiliar spectrum of the Sun, distinctly different from both the intensity spectrum (which we here refer to with the acronym SS1) and the linear polarization of the Second Solar Spectrum (for which we use acronym SS2). In analogy we refer to the new ratio spectrum as SS3. While there is hardly any resemblance between SS3 and SS2, we are able to identify a non-linear mapping that can translate SS1 to SS3 in the case of weak to medium-strong spectral lines that are mainly formed in LTE (being directly coupled to the local temperature-density structure). This non-linear mapping is successfully modeled in terms of two free parameters that are found to vary approximately linearly over the entire wavelength range covered. These parameters and the various SS3 line profiles provide a novel, rich set of observational constraints, which may be used to test the validity of model atmospheres or guide the construction of improved models.},

@techreport{pastor_yabar_inference_2021,
abstract = {We aim at demonstrating the capabilities of a newly developed method for determining electric currents in the solar photosphere. We employ three-dimensional radiative magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to produce synthetic Stokes profiles in several spectral lines with a spatial resolution similar to what the newly operational 4-meter Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) solar telescope should achieve. We apply a newly developed inversion method of the polarized radiative transfer equation with magneto-hydrostatic (MHS) constraints to infer the magnetic field vector in the three-dimensional Cartesian domain, $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}mathbf\backslash{\{}B\backslash{\}}(x,y,z),\backslash{\$} from the synthetic Stokes profiles. We then apply Ampere's law to determine the electric currents, $\backslash${\$}\backslash{\{}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}bf j\backslash{\}}\backslash{\$}, from the inferred magnetic field, $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}mathbf\backslash{\{}B\backslash{\}}(x,y,z),\backslash{\$} and compare the results with the electric currents present in the original MHD simulation. We show that the method employed here is able to attain reasonable reliability (close to 50 $\backslash${\%} of the cases are within a factor of two, and this increases to 60 $\backslash${\%}-70 $\backslash${\%} for pixels with $\backslash${\$}B{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ge300\backslash{\$} G) in the inference of electric currents for low atmospheric heights (optical depths at 500 nm $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}tau\backslash{\_}\backslash{\{}5\backslash{\}}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}in\backslash{\$}[1,0.1]) regardless of whether a small or large number of spectral lines are inverted. Above these photospheric layers, the method's accuracy strongly deteriorates as magnetic fields become weaker and as the MHS approximation becomes less accurate. We also find that the inferred electric currents have a floor value that is related to low-magnetized plasma, where the uncertainty in the magnetic field inference prevents a sufficiently accurate determination of the spatial derivatives. We present a method that allows the inference of the three components of the electric current vector at deep atmospheric layers (photospheric layers) from spectropolarimetric observations.},

@article{worden_evolving_nodate,
abstract = {We describe a procedure intended to produce accurate daily estimates of the magnetic flux distribution on the entire solar surface. Models of differential rotation, meridional flow, super-granulation, and the random emergence of background flux elements are used to regularly update unobserved or poorly observed portions of an initial traditional magnetic synoptic map that acts as a seed. Fresh observations replace model estimates when available. Application of these surface magnetic transport models gives us new insight into the distribution and evolution of magnetic flux on the Sun, especially at the poles where canopy effects, limited spatial resolution, and foreshortening result in poor measurements. We find that meridional circulation has a considerable effect on the distribution of polar magnetic fields. We present a modeled polar field distribution as well as time series of the difference between the northern and southern polar magnetic flux; this flux imbalance is related to the heliospheric current sheet tilt. We also estimate that the amount of new background magnetic flux needed to sustain the 'quiet-Sun' magnetic field is about 1.1 × 1023 Mx d-1 (equivalent to several large active regions) at the spatial resolution and epoch of our maps. We comment on the diffusive properties of supergranules, ephemeral regions, and intranetwork flux. The maps are available on the NSO World Wide Web page.},

abstract = {We compare line-of-sight magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The line-of-sight magnetic signal inferred from the calibrated MDI data is greater than that derived from the HMI data by a factor of 1. 40. This factor varies somewhat with center-to-limb distance. An upper bound to the random noise for the 1″ resolution HMI 720-second magnetograms is 6. 3 Mx cm -2, and 10. 2 Mx cm -2 for the 45-second magnetograms. Virtually no p-mode leakage is seen in the HMI magnetograms, but it is significant in the MDI magnetograms. 12-hour and 24-hour periodicities are detected in strong fields in the HMI magnetograms. The newly calibrated MDI full-disk magnetograms have been corrected for the zero-point offset and underestimation of the flux density. The noise is 26. 4 Mx cm -2 for the MDI one-minute full-disk magnetograms and 16. 2 Mx cm -2 for the five-minute full-disk magnetograms observed with four-arcsecond resolution. The variation of the noise over the Sun's disk found in MDI magnetograms is likely due to the different optical distortions in the left- and right-circular analyzers, which allows the granulation and p-mode to leak in as noise. Saturation sometimes seen in sunspot umbrae in MDI magnetograms is caused by the low intensity and the limitation of the onboard computation. The noise in the HMI and MDI line-of-sight magnetic-field synoptic charts appears to be fairly uniform over the entire map. The noise is 2. 3 Mx cm -2 for HMI charts and 5. 0 Mx cm -2 for MDI charts. No evident periodicity is found in the HMI synoptic charts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {In this work we propose a multiprocessor architecture to reach high performance in floating point operations by using radiation tolerant FPGA devices, and under narrow time and power constraints. This architecture is used in the PHI instrument that carries out the scientific analysis aboard the ESA's Solar Orbiter mission. The proposed architecture, in a SIMD flavor, is aimed to be an accelerator within the Data Processing Unit (it is composed by a main Leon processor and two FPGAs) for carrying out the RTE inversion on board the spacecraft using a relatively slow FPGA device – Xilinx XQR4VSX55–. The proposed architecture squeezes the FPGA resources in order to reach the computational requirements and improves the ground-based system performance based on commercial CPUs regarding time and power consumption. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of using this FPGA devices embedded in the SO/PHI instrument. With that goal in mind, we perform tests to evaluate the scientific results and to measure the processing time and power consumption for carrying out the RTE inversion.},
